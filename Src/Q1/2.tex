% Use LTSpice to verify your answer and to look for differences between an FFT and the theoretical Fourier
% Transform.
% As a hint, your LTSpice and calculated plots should be very similar at lower frequencies but there will be
% some small differences at higher frequencies. If your plot looks completely different then something isn’t correct.
% You should try to compare your result from the derivation and the LTSpice result on the same plot (export
% data from LTSpice to Excel, etc). Also think carefully about:
%  The frequency range used - you need to make this is wide enough to see any/all differences (i.e. starts at
% a low enough frequency and finishes at a high enough frequency)
%  The axis scales used, see tutorial notes and example spreadsheet.
%  The simulation settings used - does changing the simulation stop time, time-step and FFT sample settings
% have any influence?
% [Report: Figure comparing your computed FT with an FFT from LTSpice, some comments on how well they
% agree and an explanation of what can cause any differences.]
