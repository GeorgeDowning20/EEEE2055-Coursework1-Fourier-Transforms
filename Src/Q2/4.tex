% Generate Frequency Response plots from your Impulse Response using an FFT. Compare the LTSpice Fre-
% quency Response with your answer to 2.1, how does the Impulse Approximation affect the frequency response
% that you see?

% Include an answer to this question: The frequency response of a circuit is not usually computed using LT-
% Spice by taking an FFT of the Impulse Response, there is another method. What is it? (You donâ€™t need to do
% any further simulations) [Report: Figure(s) comparing computed Frequency Response (2.1) to response obtained
% using LTSpice and comments on: how IR approximation affects results, how FR is usually calculated in software
% such as LTSpice.]
