% Obtain an approximation for the impulse response of the circuit using a time-domain simulation in LTSpice.
% You need to drive the filter circuit with a Dirac delta function to obtain an output voltage waveform that
% represents the Impulse Response. You cannot use an actual Dirac delta function in LTSpice so you must use
% an approximation.
% Justify the delta approximation you have used and modify the simulation model to test if your approxima-
% tion is influencing the results you obtain - try a few variations on the Delta approximation to see what happens.
% [Report: Figure(s) comparing computed Impulse Response to response obtained using LTSpice and effect of
% different delta approximations, some comments to explain how/why certain delta functions give the correct
% answer but some donâ€™t.]
